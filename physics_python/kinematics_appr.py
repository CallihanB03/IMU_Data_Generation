"""
The data is organized in a pandas dataframe with each row corresponding to a time segment.

(*) Approximated a time tensor for the data by:
1) Calculating sampling_period 
    sampling_period = 1 / sampling frequency = 1 / 55 Hz = 0.01818...

2) Multiplying sampling_period by sampling window to approximate 
the length of the sampling window in seconds. 
Suppose the sampling window = 1485, then
    sampling_len_in_seconds = sampling_period * sampling_window = 27 seconds

Then, in this example, each time segment is assumed to be approximately 27 seconds.

Each segment has a acceleration mean and acceleration standard deviation for
each of the x, y, and z directions.

The acceleration tensor for the data is given as a tensor where each element is drawn from a
Normal distribution with mean=acceleration mean and standard deviation=acceleration standard deviation.

(**) Approximated a velocity tensor for the data by using the definition of velocity.
v(t) = âˆ«a(t) + v(0) where v(t) and a(t) are functions of velocity and acceleration
wrt time respectively.

v(0) is assumed to be 0 m/s (I believe all studies began with 
participants resting their hands on a table)
